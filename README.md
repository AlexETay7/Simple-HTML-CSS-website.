# Simple HTML + CSS Website
A website created for fun. Uses HTML and CSS to loop a video as the background of the website. One of my first coding projects.

### ***Overview***
Simply clone the repository and run the index.html file on a live server. A live server is used by right-clicking the index.html file and selecting the "Live Server" option.
If I remember correctly you may have to download an extension from the VS Code "Extensions" tab for a live server. May add to this sometime in the future.
